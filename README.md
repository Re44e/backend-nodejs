<h3>Technical test promoted by the company: Moovin</h3>

**Overview**

The assessment consists of developing a banking services API using Node.js and TypeScript. 

**Solution description**

Implements a REST API using tools like Express.js, Mongoose, MongoDB, and Postman.<br>
The Postman was instrumental in the tests. In addition, it provided a quick and versatile construction of the API documentation.

A database migration tool has also been integrated for testing purposes: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/migrate-mongo">Reference</a>

**Thinking about the performance of the development environment**

I integrated Sucrase to optimize the TypeScript compilation process. Also, I configured Nodemon to automate fixes on the server. <br>
I also configured the VSCode debug mode.

**Instructions for running the project**

Install the dependencies:
```zsh
  root@ yarn
```
Run project:
```zsh
  root@ yarn run dev
```
