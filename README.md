<h3>Technical evaluation promoted by the company: Moovin</h3>

**Overview**

The assessment consists of developing a banking services API using Node.js and TypeScript. 

**Solution description**

The solution implements an abstraction algorithm for elementary banking services such as withdrawals and deposits.

**Thinking about the performance of the development environment** <br>
I integrated Sucrase to optimize the TypeScript compilation process. Also, I configured Nodemon to automate fixes on the server. <br>
I also configured the VSCode debug mode.<br>
**Note:** And Although it is not mandatory, I used MongoDB for data persistence.

**Instructions for running the project**

Install the dependencies:
```zsh
  root@ yarn
```
Run project:
```zsh
  root@ yarn run dev
```
