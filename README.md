**Technical evaluation promoted by the company: Moovin**

**Overview**

The assessment consists of developing a banking services API using Node.js and TypeScript. 

**Solution description**

The solution implements an abstraction algorithm for elementary banking services such as withdrawals and deposits.

**Note:** <br>
Thinking about the performance of the development environment, I integrated Sucrase to optimize the <br>
TypeScript transpilation process. Also, I configured Nodemon to automate fixes on the server.

**Instructions for running the project**

Install the dependencies:
```zsh
  $ yarn
```
Run project:
```zsh
  $ yarn run dev
```
